# Microsoft Azure Event Hubs Client for Golang

Azure Event Hubs is a highly scalable publish-subscribe service that can ingest millions of events per second and 
stream them into multiple applications. This lets you process and analyze the massive amounts of data produced by your 
connected devices and applications. Once Event Hubs has collected the data, you can retrieve, transform and store it by 
using any real-time analytics provider or with batching/storage adapters. 

Refer to the [online documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/) to learn more about Event Hubs in 
general.

## Examples

Event Hub instance.
